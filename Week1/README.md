# How to create Tip Calculator App for iOS

1. Download Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
2. Open Xcode, Click create new project, select Single View App for template, enter a product name (Tip Calculator, First App, etc.), and create project
3. XCode has 5 main areas, as shown below:
  1. **Toolbar (Green):** displays key information about project, expand/collapse other areas, run project
  2. **Navigator (Orange):** Find files, search in your project, manage source control, navigate errors
  3. **Editor Area (Red):** Write code, build UI with storyboard, change project settings
  4. **Utilities (Purple):** Gives info about files, set properties of items in Interface Builder
  5. **Debug Area (Blue):** Test and debug your code at runtime
4. Initially, choose a simulator (ie iPhoneX, iPhone 8) from the top left and click the play/run button to start up your simulator
5. Click on the Main.storyboard file to view the visual layout for your app. Initially, you are given an empty screen
..* **Note:** For more information of storyboards, you can check out:
6. Head to the bottom right of the screen and click on the Object Library tab (circle with a little square in it). In this view, you can find a list of UI elements such as buttons, labels, and textfields that you can drag and drop onto your screen. 
Drag and drop a Label from the Object library onto the screen on your storyboard. Click on the label and type to set the text of the label to whatever you like (ie, Tip Calculator).
